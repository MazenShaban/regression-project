# Regression Model

It's an implementation for two models in R. First, the simple model uses one variable as an input
and fits a straight line that minimizes the error and predict the obesity type. The second one is
a multiple model that outputs the obesity type according to multiple features. After that, taking
the most effective features, using a correlation matrix and heat map, to make dimensionality
reduction to get a reduced version of the multiple model, then perform a partial F-test to compare
them and determine which one is better.
